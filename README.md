# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?  
Timely delivery ensures that projects stay within budget, meet stakeholder expectations, and remain competitive. Project managers can achieve this by setting realistic deadlines, using agile methodologies, prioritizing tasks, and monitoring progress regularly.  

2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?  
Cost control helps maintain profitability and prevents resource wastage. Strategies include detailed budgeting, continuous monitoring, risk assessment, and using cost management tools.  

3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?  
Agile is flexible, iterative, and allows continuous feedback but may lack clear documentation. Waterfall follows a linear approach with well-defined phases but is less adaptable to changes.  

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?  
Agile suits projects requiring rapid iterations, such as mobile app development. Waterfall is ideal for projects with fixed requirements, like government or compliance-driven software.  

5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?  
Methods include automated testing, code reviews, user feedback, and continuous integration. High standards ensure reliability, security, and user satisfaction.  

6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?  
Clear scope prevents scope creep and misalignment. A WBS breaks down tasks into manageable units, improving planning and resource allocation.  

7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?  
A detailed schedule enhances time management and accountability. Gantt charts visualize timelines, dependencies, and progress.  

8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?  
The software addresses financial accessibility by enabling savings, transactions, and loans. These issues impact financial inclusion and economic stability.  

9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?  
A well-defined problem ensures the solution directly addresses user needs, minimizing wasted effort and enhancing usability.  

10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?  
A simple, secure, and user-friendly platform that enables seamless financial transactions, savings, and loan access.  

11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?  
Instant M-Pesa transfers, automated savings, quick loan approvals, and a user-friendly interface.  

12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?  
Kenya’s mobile money market is growing rapidly, with increasing demand for digital financial services.  

13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?  
Market trends help identify user preferences, competitive gaps, and emerging opportunities, ensuring better product-market fit.
